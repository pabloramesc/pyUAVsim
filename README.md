# Python UAV Simulator
A Python unmanned aircraft simulator based on the book *Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice* by Randy Beard and Tim McLain.

## Overview
The Python UAV Simulator provides a comprehensive environment for simulating the behavior of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It allows users to explore aircraft dynamics, sensor readings, autopilot behavior, and actuator responses in a controlled simulation framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Python UAV Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pabloramesc/pyUAVsim.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd pyUAVsim
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the example:
   ```bash
   python example.py
   ```
   
## Description
The simulator is composed of four main modules, each with distinct responsibilities and submodules. These modules are organized into three levels: Physical, Electrical, and Software.

### Physical Level (Aircraft)
**Forces and Moments**:
Takes the current aircraft state and control deltas from the actuators.
Computes the forces (fx, fy, fz) and moments (l, m, n) acting on the aircraft.

**Kinematics and Dynamics**:
Uses the current state and forces and moments to compute the new state of the aircraft.

### Electrical Level
**Sensors**:
Simulates sensor readings and noise based on the true aircraft state.
Includes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS, barometer, etc.

**Actuators**:
Takes autopilot control commands and computes the state of the actuators (servos and DC motors).
Outputs the control deltas for the aircraft simulator, closing the loop in the simulation.

### Software Level (Autopilot)
**Estimation Filters**:
Applies filters (e.g., Low Pass Filter, Kalman Filter) to sensor readings to estimate the aircraft state.

**Controll and Navigation**:
Uses the estimated state along with mission parameters or joystick/controller input to manage attitude control, path following (line or orbit), path managing, and path planning.
